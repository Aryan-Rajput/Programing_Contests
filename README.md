# C++ Programming Contest Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming contest problems and exercises. It serves as a personal archive of my journey in learning C++ and improving my problem-solving skills.

## Purpose

The main purposes of this codebase are:

1. To document my solutions to programming contest problems
2. To track my progress in learning C++
3. To improve my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills
4. To serve as a reference for future contest preparations

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/AT`: Contains solutions grouped by Atcoder platform
- `/CC`: Contains solutions grouped by CodeChef platform
- `/CF`: Contains solutions grouped by Codeforces platform
- `/LC`: Contains solutions grouped by Leetcode platform
- `/Random`: Contains random solutions
- `/TopicBased`: Contains topic based solutions 

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the solutions. Each file is named according to the problem it solves and contains:

- The problem statement is in the file name or else its denoted by <date>_<problem_category> - eg - 2024AUG30_A.cpp
- The solution code
- Any additional notes or explanations
- Reason for the incomplete Code if not completed

To run any of the solutions:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the solution
3. Compile the file: `g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp -o output`
4. Run the compiled program: `./output`

## Learning Resources

Here are some resources I've found helpful in my C++ and competitive programming journey:

- [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

## Contribution

While this is a personal learning repository, I'm open to discussions and suggestions. Feel free to open an issue if you spot any bugs or have ideas for improvements.

## Disclaimer

- These solutions are meant for learning purposes. If you're currently participating in the same contests, please don't use these solutions directly - it's against the spirit of competitive programming and won't help you learn.
- Some of the code in the codebase are done throught AI like Cody, Gemini or ChatGPT to get insights from there code and I will solve them at a later date
